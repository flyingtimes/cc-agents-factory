# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a new repository named "cc-agents-factory" that appears to be in the initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only a Claude Code configuration directory with basic permissions settings.

## Current State

- **Empty repository**: No source code, package.json, or project files present
- **Claude Code configured**: Basic permissions set for bash commands (ls and find operations)
- **Platform**: Windows environment

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Create package.json for Node.js projects or appropriate build files for other technologies
3. Set up source control if not already configured
4. Install necessary dependencies once the project structure is defined

## Claude Code Permissions

Current permissions allow:
- `Bash(ls:*)` - Directory listing operations
- `Bash(find:*)` - File searching operations

Additional permissions will need to be configured as the project grows and requires more complex operations.
